Images in folder sample_images1 are used to apply convolution, taking the derivative and gradient of the image to extract the edges out of from the image.

Images in folder sample_images2 are used to apply segmentation according to different thresholds. Then figuring out which threshold is the best depending on ground truth(using Pathagoras Theorem)
